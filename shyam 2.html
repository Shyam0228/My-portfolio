        <div class="project-name">AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT</div>
        <div class="project-description">This report provides INTERPOL’s insights into key cyberthreats that are affecting the African region. It 
          also presents in-depth analysis on the impact of these threats as well as examples of INTERPOL’s 
          operational support in combating cybercrime and the regional cybercrime strategy for Africa. Based 
          on input from the member countries in Africa and data drawn from INTERPOL’s private partners, the
          most prominent threats were identified as below.
          > Online Scams – For African member countries, the highest-reported and most pressing 
          cyberthreat across the region was identified as online scamming. This threat seeks to target 
          and take advantage of victims’ fears, insecurities, and vulnerabilities through phishing, mass 
          mailing and social engineering. Member countries have reported a sharp increase in the 
          number of online banking scams, including instances of banking and credit card fraud.
          > Digital Extortion – This threat is also identified as one of the most prominent cyberthreats
          within the region. Digital extortion seeks to target individuals with either allegations of sexually 
          compromising images or through direct blackmail campaigns. While such threats are not new 
          on the threat landscape, the move towards a digital society – particularly within the African 
          region – has created new attack vectors for criminals to both obfuscate their identity and 
          target new victims.
          > Business Email Compromise – Alongside online scams, Business Email Compromise (BEC) was 
          identified as a significant concern and threat to the region. Businesses and organizations that 
          rely heavily on wire transfer transactions are vulnerable to this threat in Africa. The COVID-19 
          pandemic has contributed to the increase in this type of cybercrime.
          > Ransomware – The threat of ransomware is expanding across the African continent. Allegedly, 
          more than 61% of companies in thisregion were affected by ransomware in 2020 alone.
          1 These 
          attacks targeted some African countries’ critical infrastructure, including healthcare and 
          maritime sectors.
          2
          > Botnets – Botnets are networks of compromised machines used as a tool to automate largescale campaigns such as DDoS attacks, phishing, malware distribution, etc. The number of 
          botnet victim detections in Africa was around 50,000, with a monthly average detection of 
          3,900. In Africa, there have been numerous high-profile instances of such DDoS attacks on 
          critical infrastructure within the past five years.
          Recognizing the need for a change in the approach to cybercrime within Africa as a region that is 
          embracing digital transformation, the report concludes with INTERPOL’s regional cybercrime strategy
          to support member countries in Africa. The strategy encompasses the four strategic objectives below:
          > Enhancing cybercrime intelligence for effective responses to cybercrime;
          > Strengthening cooperation for joint operations against cybercrime;
          > Developing regional capacity and capabilities to combat cybercrime;
          > Promoting good cyber hygiene for a safer cyberspace.
          INTERPOL stands ready to support African member countries in fulfilling these objectives and further 
          developing a joint operational framework to improve coordinated actions against cybercrime in Africa. 
          Collective efforts in sharing intelligence and formulating a joint operational framework will boost 
          regional capabilities and capacity in the fight against cybercrime.

        <div class="project-description">Within the past 12 months, ransomware attacks have forced a 157-year-old college to close its doors, a leading automaker to 
          halt operations for a day, and an entire nation to declare a state of emergency. After dominating the headlines for several years, 
          these kinds of stories may feel like old news by now. Yet the escalation of the ransomware threat into a global crisis keeps it at 
          the top of the cybersecurity agenda for many organizations. 
          A recent SpyCloud sponsored survey of enterprise CISOs found that ransomware is the most concerning issue they face today. 
          And for good reason: 66% of organizations were hit by ransomware in 2021, compared to 37% in 2020.
          Not only is ransomware more prolific but threat actors also have gotten savvier – they succeeded in encrypting data in 65% of 
          attacks last year, up from 54% in 2020. Adding to the injury is the fact that the majority of ransomware schemes now involve 
          double extortion, with attackers stealing data first and threatening to leak it if the ransom isn’t paid. Just two years ago, only one 
          gang used this tactic while today it’s present in 77% of attacks.
          In last year’s Ransomware Defense Report, we learned that organizations felt pessimistic about their prospects of avoiding 
          an attack. Only 18% of those surveyed believed a ransomware incident wasn’t likely to happen to their organization, while 22% 
          believed it would likely happen multiple times. We wanted to see how things have changed since then – and this year’s survey 
          found that organizations feel even less confident today in their ability to fight back. 
          As we discuss in this report, ransomware remains a broad, persistent, and complicated problem to solve. To help organizations 
          gain a more holistic understanding of this threat, we also discuss the often-overlooked aspects of ransomware attacks and how 
          organizations can address them</div>
